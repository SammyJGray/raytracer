# raytracer

A raytracer I have been creting in C. So far I have added specular and diffuses lighting, for point, directional and ambient light. The raytracer can render spheres and triangles as it's primatives, and read in wav obj files to render models. The image is made in a .ppm format. To speed up my code I have created a bounding volume heirarchy using axis alligned bounding boxes and sorting the primatives by their central x coordinate.
